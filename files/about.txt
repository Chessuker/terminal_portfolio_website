Hello, my name is Thawat Boonsuk, but you can call me Opal.

I’m studying Computer Engineering at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi. 

I’m interested in self-improvement and learning something new, whether it's technology, health, philosophy, or literature.

I love listening to rock music. My favorite bands and artists are Red Hot Chili Peppers, Oasis, Foo Fighters, Green Day, Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Nirvana, KISS, Bon Jovi, Metallica, The Rolling Stones, Queen, Aerosmith, Linkin Park, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, TOTO, Tears For Fears, and more.

That’s a little about me. 

Thanks for reading, good luck.
